In this repository, there are 3 projects. The developed language is C#. The framework used is ASP.NET. The challenges to be completed as part of the technical test are as follows:

1. Given a string, write a function that reverses the order of the words. For example, if the input is "Hello World!", the output should be "World! Hello". 

   This exercise should go into the String folder and click on the solution.

2. Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the largest difference between any two numbers in the array. For example, given the array [2, 6, 3, 1, 9, 8], the function should return 8 since the largest difference is between 1 and 9. 

   This exercise should go into the differentNumbers folder and click on the solution.

3. Using any programming language, create a program that manages a collection of books. The program should have the following functionality:
   - Create a new book: Prompt the user to enter the book title, author, and publication year, then store the book information in a data structure using a database.
   - Read the list of books.
   - Update a book.
   - Delete a book.

   This exercise should go into the differentNumbers folder and click on the solution.

Then go to the appsettings.Development.json file, go to line 3, and change "Data Source=ELENAUMANZOR" to your local database name. After that, run the program.
